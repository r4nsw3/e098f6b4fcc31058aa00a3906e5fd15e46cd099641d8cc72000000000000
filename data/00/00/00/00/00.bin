  |   Enter the Gungeon is a bullet hell dungeon crawler following a band   |
  |   of misfits seeking to shoot, loot, dodge roll and table-flip their    |
  |   way to personal absolution by reaching the legendary Gungeon's        |
  |   ultimate treasure: the gun that can kill the past. Select a hero      |
  |   [or team up in co-op] and battle your way to the bottom of the        |
  |   Gungeon by surviving a challenging and evolving series of floors      |
  |   filled with the dangerously adorable Gundead and fearsome Gungeon     |
  |   bosses armed to the teeth. Gather precious loot, discover hidden      |
  |   secrets, and chat with opportunistic merchants and shopkeepers to     |
  |   purchase powerful items to gain an edge.                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Gungeon: Enter the Gungeon - a constantly evolving bullet hell    |
  |   fortress that elegantly blends meticulously hand-designed rooms       |
  |   within a procedurally-generated labyrinth bent on destroying all      |
  |   that enter its walls. But beware - the Gungeon responds to even the   |
  |   most modest victory against its sentries and traps by raising the     |
  |   stakes and the challenges found within!                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Cult of the Gundead: The Gungeon isn't just traps and chasms -    |
  |   calm your nerves and steady your aim as you face down the             |
  |   gun-totting Cult of the Gundead. These disciples of the gun will      |
  |   stop at nothing to put down the heroes in their tracks and employ     |
  |   any tactics necessary to defend their temple.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Gungeoneers: Choose between one of several unlikely heroes,       |
  |   each burdened by a deep regret and in search of a way to change       |
  |   their past, no matter the cost. Filled with equal parts courage and   |
  |   desperation, these adventurers won't hesitate to dive across          |
  |   flaming walls, roll through a wall of bullets, or take cover behind   |
  |   whatever is around to make it to their goal alive!                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Guns: Discover and unlock scores of uniquely fantastic guns to    |
  |   annihilate all that oppose you in the Gungeon - each carrying their   |
  |   own unique tactics and ammunition. Unleash everything from the        |
  |   tried and true medley of missiles, lasers, and cannonballs to the     |
  |   bizarrely effective volley of rainbows, fish, foam darts, and bees!   |
  |   Yep, bees.                                                            |
